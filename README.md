cubeArt: An art project for fun!

Aim: 
  Be able to take 3+ images, project their silhouettes onto a cube-like shape and return a 3D object that contains all images' silhouette     data

Curently entirely in python, working to make an executable binary that can return an .stl file for 3D printing
For now, can generate a graph at least.

Feedback welcome
Feel free to take and reuse anything
